# VEDM

This is Viktor Eikmanâ€™s Django miscellania (VEDM). While technically
reusable, and used in several personal Django projects, VEDM is of no
interest to you.

The main theme of VEDM is static sites. The library provides tools that
generate database contents from simpler text files that are easy to maintain.
This makes migrations, and initial databases, disposable.

## Migrations

Per Django recommendation, VEDM ships with its migrations. These are
auto-generated. In line with the main theme of VEDM, its migrations should
not be considered stable.
